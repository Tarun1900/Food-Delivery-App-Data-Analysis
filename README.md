1. This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL.
2. how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for better upcoming performance. 
3. how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.

#### Data Analysis using SQL

1. For a high-level overview of the hotels, provide us the top 5 most voted hotels in the delivery category.
2. The rating of a hotel is a key identifier in determining a restaurant’s performance. 
Hence for a particular location called Banashankari find out the top 5 highly rated hotels in the delivery category.
3. Compare the ratings of the cheapest and most expensive hotels in Indiranagar.
4. Online ordering of food has exponentially increased over time. Compare the total votes of restaurants that provide online ordering services and those that don’t provide online ordering services.
5. Number of votes defines how much the customers are involved with the service provided by the restaurants For each Restaurant type, find out the number of restaurants, total votes, and average rating. Display the data with the highest votes on the top( if the first row of output is NA display the remaining rows).
6. What is the most liked dish of the most-voted restaurant on Zomato(as the restaurant has a tie-up with Zomato, the restaurant compulsorily provides online ordering and delivery facilities.
7. To increase the maximum profit, Zomato is in need to expand its business.
